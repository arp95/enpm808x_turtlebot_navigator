\subsection*{Overview of the project}

Turtlebots are small robots that can drive around and sense their environment through a microsoft kinect sensor mounted on its body. This is an inspection robot for Acme Robotics which acts as an automated surveillance system providing security in a variety of environments. The robot navigates an unknown indoor environment and creates a real time 3-\/D map of the environment in the form of a point cloud using S\+L\+A\+M(\+Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). The robot uses the turtlebot package and the octomap package to develop the 3D map.
